For an example input file:

A 2 B C
B 1 D
C 0 
D 0

The tree looks like:

A - B - D
  \ 
    C

We get this output:

Started process A, pid=47914
Process A, pid=47914: Forked B, pid=47915
Process A, pid=47914: Forked C, pid=47916
Process A, pid=47914: Waiting for children to end 
Started process B, pid=47915
Started process C, pid=47916
Process C, pid=47916: has no child process, sleep for sometime 
Process B, pid=47915: Forked D, pid=47917
Process B, pid=47915: Waiting for children to end 
Started process D, pid=47917
Process D, pid=47917: has no child process, sleep for sometime 
Process C, pid=47916: ending process
Process D, pid=47917: ending process
Process B(pid=47915)'s child process D with pid=47917 has exited
Process B, pid=47915: ending process
Process A(pid=47914)'s child process B with pid=47915 has exited
Process A(pid=47914)'s child process C with pid=47916 has exited
Process A, pid=47914: ending process

Order of appearance of start and termination messages:

First, all the processes are created, 
Then the leaf processes start to exit, 
A parent process only exits when all its children has exited.
